# Loan Eligibility Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust and accurate model for predicting loan eligibility. It leverages machine learning techniques to classify individuals as eligible or ineligible for a loan based on various input features.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the `loan_data.csv` dataset. The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including their financial history, demographics, and loan details.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical features, and data imbalance.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features are selected and engineered to improve model performance.
3. **Model Selection:** A suitable machine learning model is chosen for classification, considering factors such as accuracy and interpretability.
4. **Model Training:** The model is trained on a portion of the dataset to learn patterns and relationships between features and loan eligibility.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The model's hyperparameters are optimized to achieve the best possible performance.
7. **Model Deployment:** The final model is deployed for real-time loan eligibility prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries.
2. Download the `loan_data.csv` dataset.
3. Run the Python script containing the model training and prediction code.
4. Input the applicant's information to obtain the loan eligibility prediction.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy score] on the test set.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting loan eligibility. The developed model can assist financial institutions in automating loan approval processes and making informed lending decisions.

## Future Work

- Explore more advanced machine learning algorithms.
- Incorporate additional features to improve model accuracy.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for loan eligibility prediction.
